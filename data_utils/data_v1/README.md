# Origin of data
The data used here was initially obtained from https://nordpil.com/resources/world-database-of-large-cities/ . There is no explicit license but it does say "we are happy to share" so I'm taking that as free use.

The nordpil data says that it in turn was obtained from https://population.un.org/wup/ .
